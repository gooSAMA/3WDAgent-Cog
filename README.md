# 3WDAgent-Cog

rasa_weight represents the weight file of 3WDAgent-Cog generates for ATIS datasets.
Thanks for your focus on our work, and this series of works are continuing
Though the kernel cods will be updated after the related works are published, we have shared our datasets SMP-Lora(qa) and SMPAgent(ch_aug). Also the rasa_weight can be used for other works.
